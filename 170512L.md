1) **Smart Contracts -**<br/>
   Simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met as known as Smart contracts. We can use them to automate the execution of an agreement. So, all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without an intermediaryâ€™s involvement or time loss.
2) **Permissioned Blockchain -**<br/>
   A distributed ledger that is not publicly accessible is known as a permissioned blockchain. Users with permissions can only access it.  The users can only perform specific actions granted to them.
